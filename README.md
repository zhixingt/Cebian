## 🌱 Why Cebian

Cebian wants to be **a tool that helps ordinary people in everyday life**. No middleman taking a cut — bring your own API key from any model provider and use it as your side-panel AI assistant.

So ————

- **No account required.** Install and use — no sign-up, no email, no login.
- **Privacy first.** Conversations, prompts, and attachments all stay in your own browser; **only when you send a message to the AI** is the relevant context forwarded to the model provider you chose.
- **Open source.** AGPL-3.0.

## ✨ Overview

Cebian is a Chrome extension that puts an AI assistant in the browser side panel. It can read the current page, pick elements, emulate mobile devices, attach files, and plug into external tools via MCP — letting you reach for AI without ever leaving the page you're on.

> About the name: "Cebian" is just the pinyin of 侧边 (cè biān) — Chinese for "the side." Nothing fancier than that.
